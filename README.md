# Balanced Glasses Display

This project focuses on the implementation of an algorithm related to hash tables. There are different hash functions that will produce hash chains of various length when the same dataset is given. The algorithm is essentially a brute-force search for the hash table with the most even distribution of elements among its buckets.  It assumes that a more even distribution will likely lead to better hash table performance in terms of avoiding collisions and reducing the time needed for lookup operations.
